# Project - OSRS Blog

## Start
First thing we're gonna do is just make an actual blog post.
I like the design/feel of some mass media sites, and I've always been a fan of newspapers, so Here's to the design direction. 

## Keep In Mind
Using Git during this project is an opporutnity to drown in documentation. 

the blog post idea is in the document title ;)








### Scrap Paper
lets try to map out what we want, and break it down piece by piece
-> its in your journal below your desk

what we want:
nav
text
rotating img
title
footer
backt to top button

white space on side
nav, title, and rotating img all up top in header
    with the nav and img taking up abt 1/4 each
    => title is 1/2 page width
text and white space follow the above scheme
nav drops down over the white space only
img rotation drops down the entire side of the page (the rightmost side)
    we want `space-between` here for all imgs in the rotation
    ideally, these images will pertain to the article itself


LETS START WITH
okay so we did the page
